# PythonTest
Some python testing stuff for lab/learning/experiments!
What I want:
1. an image read write system.
    - keep the metadata (most importantly, keep the original scale after R/W)
2. an image registration system (just to prevent image drift during Z-stacking.
3. an image Z projection system
    - mean projection / max projection
4. generation/read roi file.
5. calculate intensity and generate files.
